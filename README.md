# Converting my current website to React

## Why?
My Current website was created using an html5 template with lots of random tweaking
and tons of completely unnecessary code and styling that came with the template.
Also it's cooler if I made it completely from scratch.

## How?
I am currently taking a course that will teach me the basics of Web Design, Bootstrap5, React,
Meteor, and a few more skills that I lacked when I originally created my site. Ideally, I'll be
putting what I learn to practice and use it to actually improve my website!

## When?
Slowly over time; Probably will create a few more repositories like this as I learn each utility.
(I already have used bootstrap to create a demo as well!)
Eventually I single out which style I like the most and go with it, might even go back to html5.

# Notice
This Repository will no longer be updated as I have transfered the build over to my main deployment of the site.
I had implemented a Vite react build with typescript and swc and was satisfied at the base I created.
All future updates will be done on the [main repository](https://github.com/MoshirMoshir/moshirmoshir.github.io)
